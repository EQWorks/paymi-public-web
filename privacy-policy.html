<h3>Information We Collect and Store</h3>
<p>If you choose to create an account on Paymi.com, or otherwise enter into an agreement with the Company (e.g. such as a Merchant agreement), we will retain all information submitted to us, including but not limited to, your age, gender, name, email address, password, the province you live in, home address, mobile location phone number, your transaction data, your rewards balance within your account, redemption activity, demographic data, and the financial institutions you use through our service providers, including related financial data (e.g., payment card type, financial services products, etc.).</p>

<p>To learn about your user experience and to make periodic improvements to Paymi.com, we also collect the information regularly collected by web browsers. We will automatically record information and your activity. This may include your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, country, city, browser type, the web page visited before you came to our website, information you search for on our website, locale preferences, identification numbers associated with your devices, your mobile carrier, date and time stamps, system configuration information, metadata concerning your files, and other interactions with the Service.</p>

<p>We may also use “cookies” to collect information and improve our Service. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your device. We may use “persistent cookies” to save your user ID and login password for future logins to the Service. We may use “session ID cookies” to enable certain features of the Service, to better understand how you interact with the Service, and to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing on the Service. However, none of this is associated with you as an individual. It is measured only in aggregate. Cookies do not capture your individual email address or any private information about you. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all aspects of the Service.</p>

<p>If you are also a member of a Marketing Partner’s marketing program, we may also collect information from our Marketing Partner such as: your email associated with your Paymi.com account, a description of the transactions made through our Marketing Partner’s marketing program, aggregated marketing statistics affiliated with your account with our Marketing Partner, which Merchants you have made purchases from, and other information that is relevant to provide you with the Service you request.</p>

<p>From time to time, you may be asked to provide additional Personal Information for the purpose described in this Policy or as described to you at the point of collection (e.g., if you decide to enter a promotional contest, we may ask you to submit additional information in order to participate – for more information, see also “Surveys” below.).</p>

<p>Using the information gathered about you over time by us or our service providers as described above, Paymi.com may engage in interest-based advertising, or “online behavioural advertising”, which includes ads presented to you after you leave Paymi.com that encourage you to return. These ads may also include offers we think are relevant to you based on your shopping habits or online activities, and they may be served on websites or applications. We may serve these ads, or third party advertisers and ad networks may serve you these ads. Many of these third parties have opt-out mechanisms for their ad cookies. For more information about your choices, please see and visit: http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ and http://youradchoices.ca/choices/.</p>

<li>when appropriate to prevent, limit, or otherwise prosecute fraud, any unlawful activity, or any misuse of the Service to our Merchants, Marketing Partners or other third parties;</li>
<li>when we are required or authorized by law to do so (e.g., if a court issues a subpoena);</li>

<h3>Location of Information and Service Providers</h3>
<p>We endeavour to store, access, and use Personal Information in Canada. However, unless there is a legal or regulatory requirement to keep such information in Canada, Personal Information may also be stored, accessed, or used outside of Canada. For instance, we use the services of various third party companies and contractors ("Service Providers") in the conduct of our business and in order to provide our Services to you. These Service Providers provide us with payment processing services, information technology services for our software applications, marketing and survey services, and other essential services. These Service Providers may, from time to time, collect, use, store, disclose, and process Personal Information on our behalf only as necessary to provide services to us. These Service Providers may be located in different locations and as such, your Personal Information may be stored, processed, or transferred into or out of various countries. We take all reasonable measures and precautions to protect your Personal Information when it is being handled by our Service Providers.</p>

<p>When we engage a Service Provider outside of Canada, Personal Information may be stored, accessed or used in any country where the Service Provider is located, or from which it provides services. Where Personal Information is located outside of Canada, it is subject to the laws of that jurisdiction.</p>

<p>If you wish to obtain more information on our use of Service Providers and our policies and practices regarding such Service Providers, please contact us as at support@paymi.com.</p>

<h3>Business Transactions</h3>
<p>We may use and disclose your Personal Information in connection with the proposed or actual financing, sale, or other business transaction involving part or all of our business or assets. Such use and disclosure would be for the purpose of allowing third parties to determine whether to proceed with the proposed transaction, and if the transaction proceeds, for the purpose of completing the transaction. Assignees or successors to our business or assets may use and disclose your Personal Information for the purposes described in this policy. You will be notified via email or a prominent notice on our web site of any change in ownership or uses of your Personal Information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your Personal Information.</p>

<h3>Surveys</h3>
<p>From time to time, we may conduct surveys via Paymi.com. If you choose to participate, we use your response to come up with the survey results and, sometimes, to publish those results in aggregate on Paymi.com. We will never permanently record or report any response you give on its own or connect it to your name or address. We will hold these responses only as anonymous statistics.</p>

<h3>Public Forums</h3>
<p>Paymi.com may offer publicly accessible blogs or community forums. You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. To request removal of your Personal Information from our blog or community forum, contact us at support@paymi.com. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your Personal Information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.</p>

<h3>Linking to Other Websites</h3>
<p>Please remember that when you use a link to go from Paymi.com to another website, our Terms and Conditions and this Policy are no longer in effect. Your browsing and interaction on any other website, including any site that has a link on Paymi.com, is subject to the terms of use and privacy policy of that website. We encourage you to read the terms of use and privacy policies of the websites you visit to further understand their procedures for collecting, using, and disclosing Personal Information.</p>

<h3>How You Can Decide What Communication You'll Receive From Us</h3>
<p>Paymi.com may periodically send you email messages relating to your account, describing updates, new features, or promotional offers (if you have opted-in to receive them) related to the Services. You can choose to stop receiving certain promotional emails at any time. Simply follow the instructions included in your email, or send a request to stop to support@paymi.com.</p>

<p>As described in this Policy, we collect, use and disclose your Personal Information to allow us to provide you the best Merchant offers possible. Please note that if you, as a Member, have also separately opted-in to receive Merchant communications such as newsletters or other promotional offers from a retailer (“Merchant Communications”), opting-out of receiving Paymi.com communications does not mean that you have opted out of receiving Merchant Communications.</p>

<h3>How to Access, Update or Correct Your Personal Information</h3>
<p>To access, modify or delete your Personal Information, simply follow the instructions included on Paymi.com, or you may also send an email to support@paymi.com for us to delete your Personal Information in a reasonable time after receiving the request.</p>

<p>Subject to any exceptions prescribed by law, you can access and correct your Personal Information and challenge the accuracy and completeness of the information we have about you. We may deny access when required or authorized by law. For example, we may deny access when granting access would have an unreasonable impact on other people’s privacy or when necessary to protect our confidential commercial information and the requested information cannot be severed from the balance of the record in which it is contained. If we deny your request for access to, or refuse a request to correct information, we shall explain why.</p>

<h3>How We Protect the Security of Your Personal Information</h3>
<p>The security of your Personal Information is very important to us and we are committed to protecting the information we collect. However, we cannot take responsibility for theft, misuse, unauthorized disclosure, loss, alteration or destruction of data by a third party (such as a hacker). The Company has security measures in place at its physical facilities to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of information that we have collected from you through our Services.</p>

<h3>Consent</h3>
<p>By providing us with Personal Information, you consent to our collection, use, and disclosure of such information for the purposes identified in this Policy or otherwise at the time of collection. You may withdraw your consent to our collection, use, or disclosure at any time, provided that if you withdraw your consent to certain uses, we may no longer be able to provide Services to you.</p>

<h3>Minors</h3>
<p>Paymi.com and our Services are not intended to solicit information of any kind from individuals under the majority in their jurisdiction of residence (“Minors”) without the required consent from their parents/guardians. If we become aware of any information we possess that may belong to a Minor, we will immediately obtain parental consent to delete this information from our servers. If you are a parent/guardian and you suspect that your child may have submitted personal information to us, please contact us at support@paymi.com.</p>

<h3>Data Retention</h3>
<p>We will retain your Personal Information for as long as you are a Member, as needed to provide you Services, or as required by law. If you wish to cancel your Paymi.com account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you Services, contact us at support@paymi.com. We may retain and use your Personal Information after closure of your account as necessary to meet legal, regulatory, insurance, and audit requirements.</p>

<h3>Changes to the Policy</h3>
<p>This Policy was posted on January 09, 2018. We reserve the right to change, modify, or amend this Policy at any time. Please also read over our Terms and Conditions. We take privacy matters very seriously, and intend to stay at the forefront of privacy policy and protection matters. We will occasionally update our Policy and we will post those updates on this page. Your continued use of our Services following a change to this Policy means that you provide your consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information as set out in the updated Policy. You are responsible for revisiting this page to review our Policy updates.</p>

Please note that certain Service-related messages that we send are necessary for the proper functioning and use of the Services and you may not have the ability to opt-out of those messages.</p>
